**tether!** is game where you **wreck as many enemies as possible** using your tether, however if an enemy touches your ball then **you get obliterated**! This game has full mobile and offline support, designed as a progressive web application! This is my group's end-of-the-year project for our CS class.

## How to Play
**Click (or tap)** on the ball and **drag** it around! Use the motion of the ball and tether to **destroy each of the enemies**, the *Drifter*, the *Eye*, and the scariest of all... the *Twitchy*.

## Features
- **Fast** Load Times
- Polished, Unique Graphics (no third party libs)
- **Vibin'** Background Music
- Full **Mobile Support**
- **Offline Support**
- **Custom** Made Everything
- Progressive Web Application

## Tips
The first few levels are tutorials, after a few rounds with each character **you'll enter an endless wave** so be prepared.

Keep an eye on **enemies spawning in**, they will charge at you **blazing fast** after spawning in!

**Don't let your tether go wack**! If you move it around too much, it becomes **uncontrollable** and you have an awful time dealing with *Eyes*.

Instead of charging a *Twitchy* head on, wait for it to **run out of fuel** and then destroy it.
